    "In this tutorial, we'll explain to you how to **start the `BastionLab server` with user authentication enabled** and **connect the `client`** to it. We'll execute simple queries on BastionLab's central object, the `RemoteDataFrame`, and we'll show that the **authentication works**, by creating a connection to the server with an non-authenticated identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that BastionLab has authentication enabled *by default*. But you can also use it without authentication, which is a perfectly fine setting when deploying locally. To do that, you need to export an evironment variable before you run the server, by running `export DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION=1`.\n",
