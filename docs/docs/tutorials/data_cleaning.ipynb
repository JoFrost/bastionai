    "To start this tutorial, ensure the following are already installed in your system:\n",
    "- Python3.7 or greater (get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with your operating system’s package manager)\n",
    "- [Python Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (PyPi), the package manager\n",

    "In order to run this notebook, you will also need to install Polars, Bastionlab and download the dataset we will be using in this tutorial. You can download all of these by running the following code block, or alternatively, you can download download the dataset from Kaggle by following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data and creaing a free user account.\n",

    "This dataset is based on the Titanic dataset, one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning which contains information relating to the passengers aboard the Titanic. However, it has been modified by data scientist XX to contain some values that need cleaning up before we can start running queries!"
